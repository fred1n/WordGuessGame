Guess Word Game
Showcase your guessing game skills
This was part of our assignment to learn javascript, where you had a choice of creating one of two possible computer games: Word Guess or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.  
This repository gives you the code you'll need to play the computer Guess Work Game.  

The file structure of the project is set as follows:
├── assets
|  ├── css
|  |  └── style.css
|  ├── images
|  └── javascript
|     └── game.js
└── index.html

We had an option to choose a theme and I stayed with the demo theme of the 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. 
The game instructions are as follows:
1.	Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
2.	Display the following on the page:
3.	Press any key to get started!
4.	Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
•	If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.
•	As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.
5.	Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
6.	Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).
7.	After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
